#Migrating to Web

In many cases, the client would request support for web along with native and ios platforms. In traditional approach, we would staff one team for native android app, one for native ios app and another for web, primarily because we need three different teams with three different skill sets.

React Native paints a different picture here. Since React Native is essentially React + Native code, it becomes quite easy to add support for web in the existing application code base itself provided certain code conventions were followed.

If you do a quick search for adding web support you would find many projects like React Native Web, etc that helps you convert a existing react native project into web. Although this approach works, but it introduces certain restrictions that come with React Native itself on the web platform also. Hence, we would like to introduce an alternative approach without adding an additional library. We like to call this "Conventions based approach to multiplatform react native apps".

In the following chapters, we would first go through how to add web support using React native web and then followed by Conventions based approach.
