## Integrating with redux store

react-navigation comes with the ability to integrate with redux. Though it is optional, we highly recommend this. Before reading this chapter, please make sure that you have a basic understanding of react-navigation. If not, please have a look at [this](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/intro/).

### Why redux integration?

react-navigation maintains its internal store to keep track of stacks, routes history etc. if not configured to redux store. This was done so that it is easy to configure the library and there might be use cases when the app doesn't use redux or store linking is not required.
After installing the library and configuring routes, you will se something like this on the debugger when you navigate.

  <div style="text-align:center">

  </div>
  <br>

  As you can see, the library maintains its own store and it logs every action in the dev mode. The library also has a flexibility to integrate itself the the redux store of your application.

  While the integration is completely optional, we highly recommend you doing this if your app is already using redux because of the following reasons:

  1. It gives as a lot more flexibility to control the route state at every point of time. Consider a case where you want to call a function on every route change. You can use redux middleware for screen tracking.

  * It makes the navigation much more readable and cleaner. You just have to dispatch an action with the routeName where you want to navigate.

  * It removes the dependency of react component to be able to navigate. Consider a scenario where you want to navigate from your thunk or saga file.
