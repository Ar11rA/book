# Getting started

### **Mac OSX**

Before we can install react native onto our system we need to install few dependencies.

We need to install **node** , **watchman** and **yarn**. Run the following commands on the terminal to install them.

```
brew install node 
brew install watchman
brew install yarn
```

* **node**  -  We recommend that you install the latest version of Node.js from`https://nodejs.org/en/download/` . React native supports Node.js 4 or newer.
* **watchman** - Watchman is a file watcher from facebook. It watches files and records when they change. It can also trigger certain actions when matching files change. To know more you can visit `https://facebook.github.io/watchman/`.
* **yarn** - Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript - an alternative npm client. It was developed by Facebook in collaboration with engineers from Exponent, Google, and Tilde. We recommend yarn over npm , primarily because it has lots of performance improvements and features like Offline cache , lock file ,etc.

If you are planning to develop for **IOS** you need to install **XCode **and** Xcode Command Line Tools**.  XCode can be installed via the [Mac App store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Recommended version is Xcode 8 or higher.  Xcode Command Line Tools can be installed from within XCode. Open XCode, then choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

If you plan to develop for **Android **you need the android-sdk.
