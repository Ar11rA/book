# Getting started

### **Mac OSX**

Before we can install react native onto our system we need to install few dependencies.

We need to install **node** , **watchman** and **yarn**. Run the following commands on the terminal to install them.

```
brew install node 
brew install watchman
brew install yarn
```

* **node**  -  We recommend that you install the latest version of Node.js from`https://nodejs.org/en/download/` . 
* **watchman** - Watchman is a file watcher from facebook. It watches files and records when they change. It can also trigger certain actions when matching files change. To know more you can visit `https://facebook.github.io/watchman/`.
